# STA302-Tutorial-2
## Abstract:
There are currently 50 Automated Speed Enforcement (ASE) systems installed in Community Safety Zones near schools in the city of Toronto. 
In each ward, there are 2 systems installed which are rotated to different locations every month. We are interested in the number of speeding tickets issued in each ward from the ASE system during the most recent month of the dataset. 
We found that ward 10 had the most amount of speeding tickets issued while ward 15 had the least amount of speeding tickets issued which totaled 5977 and 102 respectively.
